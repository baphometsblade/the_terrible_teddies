# The Terrible Teddies

The Terrible Teddies is a strategic and humor-filled game that immerses players in a world of uniquely crafted teddy bear characters. With 50 individual teddies to collect and battle, each with its own set of attributes and backstories, players can engage in turn-based combat, manage their teddy collection, and progress through levels and challenges to become the ultimate teddy tactician.

## Overview

This project leverages Node.js and Express for the backend, with a MongoDB database to manage dynamic in-game content and player interactions. The frontend is rendered using EJS templates, while client-side interactions are handled with jQuery. The project is structured with models for user and teddy data, routes to facilitate game logic, and views for the user interface.
