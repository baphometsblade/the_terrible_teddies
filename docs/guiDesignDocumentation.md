## Arena GUI Improvements
- **Layout:** The arena will feature a more dynamic layout, showcasing teddies and their abilities more prominently.
- **Interactivity:** Enhanced interactivity with animations for teddies' special moves.
- **Information Display:** Clearer display of teddy stats, battle history, and current opponents.

## Menu Enhancements
- **Navigation:** Streamlined navigation, making it easier for users to find and access different parts of the game.

- **New Components:** Introduction of new components like modals for teddy customization and dropdowns for more options.

## Mockups
- Links to Figma/Adobe XD mockups will be added here after creation.

## Implementation Notes
- Developers should pay close attention to the interaction details specified in the mockups.
- The visual assets (icons, backgrounds, etc.) will be provided in the `./assets/design` directory post-design phase.
- CSS styles should be modular and consistent with existing naming conventions.

## Feedback and Iteration
- This document will be updated based on feedback from the development team and user testing sessions.
